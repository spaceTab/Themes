# Themes
# Custom built themes for XFCE and other window managers

# Current theming for XFCE

# 3bx-skimp
## A minimalist _borderless_ Window theme. Highlights focused window.

# 3bx-chunk
## A more pronounced version of 3bx-skimp With Thicker borders & a slightly different _unfocused window_ border
  
### **NOTE** to remove the windows title from the bordering of the theme
  1. Search for Settings Editor (in XFCE)
  2. Go to XFWM4 settings
  3. In title_font set the font-size to either '1' or '0' 

### If interest is shown, I can recreate these in different colors, or add tweaks. Feel free to clone themes, and make them your own!
